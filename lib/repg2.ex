  > can be located on different nodes) which are all members of the group
  > foobar. There are no special functions for sending a message to the group.
  > Instead, client functions should be written with the functions
  > get_members/1 and get_local_members/1 to find out which processes are
  > members of the group. Then the message can be sent to one or more members
  > of the group.
  >
  > If a member terminates, it is automatically removed from the group.
